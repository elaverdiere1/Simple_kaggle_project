# Simple_kaggle_project

This is just a simple project done in a short time to show my coding and commenting ability.

Using a simple kaggle project based on the mnist data set of hand written numbers.  
A neural network was used to create a classification for the different numbers.
The neural network was done on training data with predictions coming from testing dataset.

The jupyter notebook and predictions are included but the train and test data are too big to put on github.
